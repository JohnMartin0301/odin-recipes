        <p>
            This keto chocolate mousse is ideal for satisfying a sweet tooth. 
            It's so fast that it'll be ready in no time. 
            <p>There's no need to whip the heavy cream ahead of time; 
            simply combine everything in a mixing bowl and </p> <p>combine! 
            Use any granular keto-friendly sweetener that measures like sugar.
            Swerve powder dissolves <p>better for me than Swerve liquid. 
            Adjust the cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to your liking.<p>
            Because this is quite rich, you don't need much to feel satisfied.</p>
